# Model

Here we are interested in predicting the popular vote outcome of the 2020 American federal election (include citation). To do this we are employing a post-stratification technique. In the following sub-sections I will describe the model specifics and the post-stratification calculation.


## Model Specifics
To predict the popular vote outcome of the 2020 American federal election over Donald Trump and Joe Biden, I build statistical models for them separately, since different voter can support their presidential candidate for different reasons. So modeling them separately can reflect the actual situation better.

For both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, I will use logistic regression model to model the proportion of voters who will vote them. The reason why I choose logistic regression model is logistic regression is a classification algorithm, which works well when the target variable is categorical in nature. And this time, both models' target variables are whether vote certain presidential candidate or not which is binary. So logistic regression model can be a good choice here. And for the entire process of analysis, I will use R in Rstudio to perform.

```{r, include=FALSE}

# Creating the Model
model_trump <- glm(vote_trump ~ . , 
            data=survey_trump_data, family= "binomial")

model_biden <- glm(vote_biden ~ . , 
            data=survey_biden_data, family= "binomial")

# Model Results (to Report in Results section)
summary_trump <- summary(model_trump)
summary_biden <- summary(model_biden)
```

### Model for Donald Trump
For Donald Trump, I will use age, family income, race, and gender to model the probability of voting for Donald Trump. And all variables are recorded as categorical variables. The multiple logistic regression model I am using is:

$$ \ln\frac{y_T}{1-y_T} = -0.31-0.6 \cdot x_{age}+0.73 \cdot x_{income}-0.53  \cdot x_{mexican}-1.95\cdot x_{black}-1.38\cdot  x_{chinese}-0.49\cdot  x_{other}+ 0.39\cdot x_{sex} + \epsilon$$

Where $y_T$ represents the proportion of voters who will vote for Donald Trump. Similarly, $x_{age}$ represents whether the voter's age is under 30 or not. $x_{income}$ represents whether the family income is within the range of \$200,00 and \$249,999. $x_{mexican}$, $x_{black}$,  $x_{chinese}$, and $x_{other}$ show the race of the voter. And $x_{sex}$ represents the gender of the voter, where 1 is male and 0 is female. And $-0.31$ represents the probability of voting for Donald Trump when the voter is female, white, over 30 years old, and family income not in that range.

According to the multiple logistic regression model we have, we can find that. First, voters whose age greater than 30 may not likely to vote to Trump. Except white voter, all the other voter also may not vote to Trump. And male voters have high chance to vote to Trump.

The major reason why I choose these variables is the banner book for my survey data set. Refer to that book [1], we can find that there were already some analysis over the 2020 American federal election. So this time, we just use the same variable they used to do our further analysis. However, there are many subdivisions for each variable, like age which has over 80 subdivisions. So I first divide the age into different age groups. Since same generation always have similar way of thinking, I divide the age into 10-20, 20-30, and so on. Then combining the Post-Stratification data we have and P-value for each variables, I first filter the variables and only keep some important subdivision variables. Then I use $regsubset()$ function in R [2] to find the final variables, which performs best subset selection by identifying the best model that contains a given number of predictors, where best is quantified using RSS.

### Model for Joe Biden
For Joe Biden, I will use family income, race, and gender to model the probability of voting for Joe Biden. And all variables are recorded as categorical variables. The multiple logistic regression model I am using is:

$$\ln\frac{y_B}{1-y_B} = -0.35-0.54 \cdot x_{income}+0.34  \cdot x_{mexican}+1.17\cdot x_{black}+0.75\cdot  x_{chinese}+1.42\cdot  x_{japanes}- 0.28\cdot x_{sex} + \epsilon$$

Where $y_B$ represents the proportion of voters who will vote for Joe Biden. Some variables are already shown above and they have the same meaning as that in previous model. And $x_{japanes}$ represents whether the voter is Japanese or not. And we can find there is an interesting phenomenon that many variables cross in these two models and they are opposite influence on voters' decision. The voters whose family income in the range of \$200,00 and \$249,999 are not likely to vote Biden, but Trump. And Voters who are mexican, black, Chinese, or Japanes are likely to vote Biden, but not Trump. For Biden's model, I use the same method to choose variables.

## Post-Stratification 

In order to estimate the proportion of voters who will vote for Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I need to perform a post-stratification analysis. The post-stratification technique can reduce the bias of our model. Since the population of voter for 2020 American federal election are huge and various, applying the model to the whole population can lead to great bias. The post-stratification technique can divide the whole sample population into several small groups and each group has their own feature. And the bias for each group can be smaller than consider them as a whole. Then we add the result for each group up, weight them by size, and eventually calculate the average value for the whole population. In this case, we are not summarize the whole population, but also take feature of different groups into consideration. 

Here I create cells based off different ages, gender, race, and family income. First, I only keep useful data from data set and found that there are some unusual data type in variable age ("less than 1 year old" and "90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)"). Then I removed both data and also those who age is less than 18, since only those whose age are greater than 18 can vote [3] and data "90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)" already cover by other 90+ years old data. Then I split the data into different cells based on the rule I used for both Trump and Biden model. Like whether age under 30, whether the voter's race is black, and so on.

Using the model described in the previous sub-section I will estimate the proportion of voters in each cell. I will then weight each proportion estimate (within each cell) by the respective population size of that cell and sum those values and divide that by the entire population size. 

```{r, include=FALSE}

# Here I will perform the post-stratification calculation
census_trump_data$logodds_estimate <-
  model_trump %>%
  predict(newdata = census_trump_data)

census_trump_data$estimate <-
  exp(census_trump_data$logodds_estimate)/(1+exp(census_trump_data$logodds_estimate))

census_trump_data %>%
  mutate(alp_predict_prop = estimate*n) %>%
  summarise(alp_predict = sum(alp_predict_prop)/sum(n))

census_biden_data$logodds_estimate <-
  model_biden %>%
  predict(newdata = census_biden_data)

census_biden_data$estimate <-
  exp(census_biden_data$logodds_estimate)/(1+exp(census_biden_data$logodds_estimate))

census_biden_data %>%
  mutate(alp_predict_prop = estimate*n) %>%
  summarise(alp_predict = sum(alp_predict_prop)/sum(n))


```


# Results
The result for each model is calculated by
$$\hat{y}^{PS}=\frac{\sum N_j\hat{y_j}}{\sum N_j}$$
Where $\hat{y_j}$ is the estimate in each cell. And $N_j$ is the population size of the $j^{th}$ cell based off demographics. Then we have the result, 

| Donald Trump | Joe Biden |
| :-: | -: | 
| 39.5% | 41.4% |

![The estimate result for Trump and Biden](C:/Users/zzpen/Desktop/PS3/Outputs/result.png)

The left result in [Figure 1] is for Trump and the right on is for Biden, then we can find that the the proportion of voters who will vote Trump and the proportion of Biden are very close. And Joe Biden is slightly ahead of Trump. 

# Discussion

For this analysis, the survey data we used to build model is Nationscape Data Set from Voter Study Group [4], which was released in January 2020 and included around 156,000 cases. And the census dats is from American Community Surveys (ACS) which is 2018 5-year ACS. According to the banner book of the survey, we selected only few variables from 265 variables to build our multiple regression model for Trump and Biden.

![The summary result for Trump and Biden](C:/Users/zzpen/Desktop/PS3/Outputs/summary.png)

But according to the P-value for each variables [Figure 2], we can say that both model are close relative to the target variable. Since the lower the P-value, the higher the relativity to the target variable. And when we select the variables, we also use the $regsubset()$ function in R which give us the best subset selection by identifying the best model. So the model we built are somehow relative the true result. The following [Figures 3] show the result of $regsubset()$ function for both Trump model and Biden model.

![The result of regsubset function](C:/Users/zzpen/Desktop/PS3/Outputs/regfit.png)

Then we apply post-stratification technique into our multiple logistic model to reduce the bias of our models. And eventually get the result of our analysis. Based on the current model we built and the current data we have, Joe Biden is slightly ahead of Donald Trump in the 2020 American federal election.

## Weaknesses

1. In this analysis, the variable selection was based on the banner book, which limit the possibilities for research. Although it makes our analysis and model easier, but it also makes the bias larger which is not good for research. So if possible, we can try some more variables to low the bias.

2. In this analysis, we use data set from different sources, which makes it hard to manage the data. For example, in our survey, we only have 4 regions. But there are 17 regions in census data, which means they have different rules to decide the region. And these differences can also lead to a big bias.

3. The way we handle the cases who contain NA (missing value) is just remove that case, which is really greedy. Although we have a relative large data set time, those removed cases can also be useful. So we may can find a better way to handle those cases.

4. When I split census data into different cells, there are many cells with only 1 case. And I just removed those cells, which can also lead to a big bias, since those data can be useful. They represent some unique group in our census data. To solve this question, we can try to find a larger data set.

## Next Steps

In our analysis, we used the data released in January 2020 to build model. And after the result of the 2020 American federal election come out, we can gather the data again to compare the difference between January and now. And analysis why the change happened. What's more, in January 2020, the situation of COVID-19 was not that bad. Did the development of COVID-19 affect the American federal election? If so, how does it influence the result and why. After we get the result of American federal election, all these topic are worth to analysis.
